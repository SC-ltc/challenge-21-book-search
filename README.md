# Module 21 Challenge

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 

## Starter code provided by:

https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli

## Issues to address

I am unable to get the application to deploy on Render. There appears to be an issue with the bcrypt package on the server side. The render deployment is giving me an error message of "invalid ELF header". The bcrypt package was provided in the starter code.
